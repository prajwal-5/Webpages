        <h2>An inspiration to many</h2>
        <p>
          Known as the Missile Man of India, Dr APJ Abdul Kalam contributed not
          only to science but also served as the 11th President of India and was
          widely regarded as the 'People's President'. As an aerospace
          scientist, Kalam worked with India's two major space research
          organisations--Defence Research and Development Organisation (DRDO)
          and Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO). He often spoke to
          children and the country's youth — inspiring them to think big in
          life; he also penned a number of books. Here are some of his most
          inspiring quotes
        </p>
        <h2>
          “Don’t take rest after your first victory because if you fail in
          second, more lips are waiting to say that your first victory was just
          luck.”
        </h2>
        <h2>
